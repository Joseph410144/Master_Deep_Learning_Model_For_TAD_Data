# Master_Deep_Learning_Model_For_TAD_Data
This repository contains deep learning models developed during my master's research, primarily utilizing physiological signals to detect sleep-related events.
It currently provides all deep learning models that have been tested, developed, or researched, and will continue to be updated.

Master Thesis: An automatic system for detecting arousals and sleep apnea events that integrates a time-frequency information encoding network and residual stacked bidirectional long short-term memory network
